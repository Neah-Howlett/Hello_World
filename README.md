# Hello_World

Hey guys!

My name is Neah and this is my first time using Github, so I am super excited!
I am a BAIS and Marketing double major, and hope to grow my analytical skills on this platform.
I think Github will be beneficial to me, and help me develop my knowledge things of coding and data visualization.
